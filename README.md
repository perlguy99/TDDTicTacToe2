## Business Requirements

### Boxes ###
        - Boxes can be "-", "X", or "O"
            - Starting here.
        
        - When a box is tapped, it changes from "-" to "X" or "O", depending on who's turn it is
            - Test #1 (TDD 5): Check that when a box is tapped, it changes value
                - $truggle1: I just created the function before the test! Had to delete it.
                
            - Test #2 (TDD 6): Check that when it is "X's" turn, the value changes to "X"
            
            - Test #3 (TDD 7): Check that when it is "O's" turn, the value changes to "O"

                - This will need to be in the view
